# nvim

Nvim config with installation script.

### Quick setup

> [!NOTE] 
> Using nightly features. (version 0.12 I think)

```sh 
git clone https://github.com/hugoocoto/nvim 
cd nvim 
./install.sh 
```

You can use the `./install.sh -l` flag to create a symlink instead of copying
the contents of this folder. Make sure that this directory is not moved or
deleted. It’s better to clone the repo into `.config` if you want to keep it up
to date.

### Cheatsheet

There’s a file called `./vim_cheatsheet.md` with (not) all the mappings.
